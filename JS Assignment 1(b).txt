Question 1) Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
Ans) JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
 animate images, and pretty much everything else.
JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive.
 It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control 
multimedia, etc.

Q2) Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.
Ans)(i)Purpose: HTML is used for creating the structure and content of a web page, while JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to a web page.
(ii)Syntax: HTML uses markup tags to define elements, while JavaScript uses scripting language syntax.
(iii)Rendering: HTML is rendered by the browser, while JavaScript is executed by the browser.
(iv)Dynamic behavior: HTML has no built-in capabilities for creating dynamic behavior, while JavaScript can dynamically change content, styles, and respond to user interactions.
(v)Separation from content: JavaScript can be separated from the HTML and placed in a separate file, while HTML is tightly integrated with the content of a web page.
(vi)Interoperability: HTML is supported by all browsers, while JavaScript implementation may vary among browsers.
(vii)Server interaction: HTML is static and has no capability for interacting with a server, while JavaScript can communicate with a server and exchange data dynamically.
(viii)Learning curve: HTML has a relatively low learning curve, while JavaScript has a steeper learning curve due to its scripting language syntax and dynamic capabilities.

Q3)List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
Ans)  Primitive data types: The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. 
Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.
1. Number: Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.
2. String: The string data type in javascript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by 
single or double quotes.
3. Undefined: The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.
4. Boolean: The boolean data type can accept only two values i.e. true and false.
5. Null: This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.
6. BigInt: This data type can represent numbers greater than 253-1 which helps to perform operations
 on large numbers. The number is specified by writing ‘n’ at the end of the value.
7. Symbol: This data type is used to create objects which will always be unique. 
these objects can be created using Symbol constructor.

Q4)What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?
Ans) JavaScript includes variables that are used to hold the data value and it can also be changed anytime.
exp) let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
conlog.log(z);

Q5)Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.
Ans)To prevent the execution of multiple lines, a comment can be used.
a)single-line comments--
// this will output ‘hello world’ to the browser's console.
console.log(‘hello world’);

result = 3 + 7 // comments can also follow a statement like this

b)multi-line comments ---
/* Add two numbers and
   Store the output in a variable called result.
   Also, print the output to the browser’s console
*/
result = 6 * 5
console.log(‘Multiplication result is: ‘, result);

Q6)Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
Ans) Readability and Understandability: Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more readable and understandable. When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on,
 descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable.
